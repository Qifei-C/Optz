# Optimization Algorithm Implementations (OAI)

Welcome to the Optimization Algorithm Implementations repository! 

This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive code examples based on the techniques and methods taught by CMU lecturer Anupam Gupta and Ryan Oâ€™Donnell, as outlined in their *Optimization Textbook*. Also including materials from Graduate Texts in Mathematics(GTM)'s *Interger Programming* by Michele Conforti, Gerard Cornuejols, and Giacomo Zambelli. Our goal is to offer a practical, hands-on approach to understanding and applying various optimization algorithms.

Each algorithm is implemented with detailed comments to ensure clarity and ease of understanding, making these examples valuable resources for both students learning optimization and practitioners looking to refine their skills. Whether you're tackling complex optimization problems or simply curious about algorithmic strategies, this repository serves as a vital tool to enhance your computational toolkit.

Feel free to explore the implementations, suggest improvements, or contribute to expanding the range of algorithms covered. 

Happy optimizing!
