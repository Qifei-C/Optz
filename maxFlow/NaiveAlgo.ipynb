    "The Na誰ve Algorithm is a fundamental approach to solving the maximum s-t (source-to-sink) flow problem in network flow analysis. This algorithm provides an elementary method for determining the maximum flow that can be sent from a source node $s$ to a sink node $t$ within a flow network. The process involves initially sending flow along any path from $s$ to $t$ that has available capacity. The key principle behind the Na誰ve Algorithm is to repeatedly find such paths and push as much flow as possible along them until no further augmenting paths exist."
